Change name to Debian Sanctuary

A Pure Blend that will allow the installation of privacy tools on Debian.

Using Tasks, The system will install tools for providing the best privacy protection, for a specific task

I have used a modified risk assessment for identifying the Threats, and controls, which will identify the tools required:

== Risk Assessment ==

=== Task ===
Each task (Use Case).

=== Hazards ===
each line will define an individual threat:
| Tool Failure | Your computer hardware/software being exploited |
| Tool Theft   | Your computer being stolen                      |
| Theft        | Theft of value                                  |
| Surveillance | Spying                                          |
| Infiltration | infiltration into the actual system/protocol    |
| Manipulation | Manipulation of Objective                       |

=== Information ===
Categories of information that a Hazard could compromise:
| Personal    | Personal information about family, generally used for Identity theft or blackmail |
| Behavioural | Used for Selling marketing and Spying                                             |
| Financial   | Used to denote things with monetary value                                         |
| Ideological | Used to identify political affiliation                                            |
| Operational | used to identify actions and resist pressure                                      |
| Private     | information of a sensitive nature                                                 |


=== Likelihood ===
In an environment with *no* protection the possibility of compromise.


=== Control Measures ===
Based on the Hazard and the Information threatened, define countermeasures to use to mitigate risk.
| 1  | OS Choice                                | A Secure OS with minimal active exploits                                                    |
| 2  | Firewall                                 | Protect yourself by blocking direct attacks                                                 |
| 3  | Anti-virus/Malware                       | Ensure you have Updated and active virus/malware protection, this may be provided by the OS |
| 4  | Computer Use Training / User Competanccy | When using a computer to acieve tasks safely.                                               |
| 5  | Cache Purging                            | Ensure any processed information is not left where it can be recovered                      |
| 6  | Password Safe                            | If you have access passwords/keys, ensure they are stored in a safe location                |
| 7  | Disk Encryption                          | Protect your sensitive information from being recovered from silenced disks                 |

| 9  | Out of Band Authentication               | Authentication where a shared secret had been securely passed and verified                  |
| 10 | Authenticated Encryption                 | Encryption that has been secured by an Authenticated secret                                 |
| 11 | Transport Anonymity                      | A transport to prevent identification of actors communication                               |
| 12 | Perfect Forward Secrecy.                 | Encryption which ,even if intercepted, cannot be decrypted with any key                     |
| 13 | Anonymity                                | Communication cannot be identified or authenticated.                                        |
| 14 | Platform Selection                       | Choice of platform/network to use based on protection given (https://tosdr.org)             |
